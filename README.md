**Project Overview**

This project serves as a platform for practical learning and experimentation.
Its primary objective is to test various sorting algorithms, explore different data structures,
and delve into complex tree structures, including the red-black tree, among others.

**Technical Details**

- **Language**: The project is primarily implemented in the C programming language.
- **Learning Journey**: It's important to note that this project is part of an ongoing learning process.
As such, the code may not adhere to the best practices in C style, as I am simultaneously learning and
experimenting with the language.

Please feel free to explore and engage with the project, keeping in mind its educational and experimental nature.
